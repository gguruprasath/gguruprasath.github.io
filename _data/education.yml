  During my masters at SRM University, I had the opportunity to work with Electroencephalogram (EEG) to understand the frequency following effect of binaural beats on the brain waves for my thesis. I also had hands-on experience with MRI, CT, Ultrasound, X-ray during my hospital visit training program that helped me later to dive deep into exploring human cognition and behavior by probing the brain using some of these tools during my time in Cognition Lab, IISc.
