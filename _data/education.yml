   During my master's at SRM University, I had the opportunity to work with an Electroencephalogram (EEG) to understand the frequency following effect of binaural beats on the brain waves for my thesis. I also had hands-on experience with MRI, CT, Ultrasound, X-ray during my hospital visit training program. This training helped me dive deep into exploring human cognition and behavior by probing the brain using some of these tools during my Research Assistantship in Cognition Lab, IISc, Bangalore, India.- layout: left
