    During my masters at SRM University, I had the opportunity to work with Electroencephalogram (EEG) to understand the frequency following effect of binaural beats on the brain waves for my thesis. I also had hands on experience with MRI, CT, Ultrasound, X-ray during my hospital visit training program that helped me later to dive deep into understanding the human cognition and behavior by probing brain using these tools during my RA'ship in Cognition Lab,IISc.
