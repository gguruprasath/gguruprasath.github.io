    This is one of the very few longitudinal studies done on the Asian population (India) to understand the healthy aging and cognitive decline in the elderly urban cohort. The study aims at the identification of the non-invasive biomarkers of Alzheimer's dementia through ehavioral and neuroimaging approaches.

    I started this project as a fresh graduate with a Biomedical Engineering background specialized in Radiology. In addition to learning to code with Matlab and Python, I collected and analyzed more than 400+ human behavior and 250+ Neuroimaging data. This project helped me understand the deteriorating human cognition across life span while interacting with the healthy, mild cognitively impaired as well as Alzheimerâ€™s patients. It shaped the way I interact with my colleagues and provided me an extraordinary opportunity to work with awesome collaborators with a diverse background in mathematics, engineering, and biological sciences.
